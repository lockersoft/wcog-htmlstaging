                    Sharing a ride, if only once a week, makes a big difference. Whether you share a ride to work,
                    school, or to a fun activity, it takes an extra car off the road. Some employers assist employees in
                    finding rideshare partners or you might already have a work or school buddy you can make
                    arrangements with. There are also apps and services that can help you find a match.

                    right for you. Even then, agree that you may wish to break it off down the road. It’s ok to be
                    noncommittal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span

                    If each person in the carpool takes a turn in driving to the same destination, then there may be no
                    need to worry about money. However, some people prefer to drive, others prefer to ride. In that
                    case, each rider should contribute a reasonable fare to cover gas, parking, and wear on the driver’s
                    car. There are calculators online to help determine costs.<br /></span
