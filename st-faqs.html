                        <dd>
                            <p>Any trip made by walking, bicycling, sharing a ride or riding the bus that replaces a
                                drive-alone vehicle trip. Your trip must start or end in Whatcom County. Smart Trips can be
                                recorded by anyone age 14 or older. Walking and bicycling for exercise are not eligible as
                                Smart Trips. Walking and bicycling to leisure activities are eligible as Smart Trips.</p>
                            <p>Ridesharing is defined as two or more licensed drivers sharing a ride to the same destination
                                or separate destinations along the same path of travel. The rideshare trip must eliminate a
                                drive-alone vehicle trip. Ridesharing among young people 14–18 years old is not eligible as
                                a Smart Trip.</p>

                            <p>Whatcom Smart Trips promotes transportation by walking, bicycling, sharing rides, and riding
                                the bus. These trips:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Reduce traffic congestion</li>
                                <li>Build a more efficient transportation system that provides more mobility and access for
                                    less cost.
                                </li>
                                <li>Provide health benefits to individuals</li>
                                <li>Strengthen social connections</li>
                                <li>Create a more vibrant local business community</li>
                                <li>Reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other types of air and water pollution.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Whatcom Smart Trips encourages people to try alternatives to driving alone and rewards those
                                who are already making Smart Trips. It applies to all trips, including the trip to work,
                                errands, school, or leisure activities.</p>

                            <p>Whatcom Smart Trips will comply with the IRS reporting requirements for prize winners.
                                According to the IRS instructions, a Form 1099–MISC is required for any person receiving
                                over $600 in prizes and awards. Recipients of prizes qualifying for a 1099–MISC must agree
                                to provide the information necessary for the 1099-MISC in order to receive their prize; they
                                should expect to receive their forms in time to file their appropriate tax returns.</p>

                            <p>If there is more than one licensed person in the car for the trip, then it counts as a
                                ridesharing trip. Driving alone in a hybrid or electric vehicle is not an eligible Smart
                                Trip.</p>
                            <p>Hybrid and electric vehicles provide savings to individual drivers and contribute positively
                                to the community, but not in the same way as walking, bicycling, sharing rides and riding
                                the bus. These latter four forms of travel are promoted by Whatcom Smart Trips for the full
                                range of individual and community benefits that they provide. Please see our program goals
                                described above.</p>

                            <p>If there is more than one licensed person riding the motorcycle, then the trip counts as a
                                ridesharing trip. Riding a motorcycle by oneself is not an eligible Smart Trip.</p>
                            <p>Motorcycles provide savings to individual riders and contribute positively to the community
                                by consuming much less fossil fuel. Other community benefits are less certain. For example,
                                according to the EPA, current motorcycle engines pollute at a rate 90 times higher per mile
                                than passenger cars or even a large sport utility vehicle. More information on this issue
                                may be found through the EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality.</p>
                            <p>Walking, bicycling, sharing rides and riding the bus are promoted by Whatcom Smart Trips for

                                considered ridesharing trips when more than one licensed person is riding the scooter.
                                Riding a motorcycle type scooter by oneself is not an eligible Smart Trip for the same
                                reasons described above for motorcycles.</p>

                                average emissions and fuel consumption for passenger cars. The document also contains

                                quick and simple. Asking participants to log every leg of their trip would be an undue
                                burden. Since mileage is self-reported, we acknowledge it's not one hundred percent
                                accurate. Our intention with the diary and calendar is to encourage people to be mindful of

                            <p>A commute trip reduction program was started at the Whatcom Council of Government in 1997
                                working with local employers to reduce drive alone car trips for work commutes. Starting in
                                summer of 2003, a community wide trip reduction project, Smart Trips contest, was launched
                                focusing on all trips, not just work. The goal was to alleviate traffic congestion in
                                Bellingham during an I-5 construction project. Over the summer of 2004, a pilot marketing
                                project was launched for the purpose of continuing to reduce drive alone car trips. In July
                                of 2006 the Whatcom Smart Trips program was officially launched. A year long in-depth
                                mobility survey was conducted in 2007 with a follow-up survey conducted in 2009. Results
                                found, among many interesting facts about travel habits, that the Smart Trips program was
                                effective in encouraging community members to walk, bike, bus or share a ride instead of
                                driving in a car alone. Since that time, the program has continued to work with employers
                                and individuals encouraging the choice of making Smart Trips over driving.</p>
