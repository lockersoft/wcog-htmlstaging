                        room to get started. Depending on your ability level we may remove
                        the pedals from your bike and lower the seat so you can get the feel
                        of balancing by just pushing with your feet. Most people quickly
                        progress to adding the pedals and riding in just one session. You
                        may need more than one session of this class to be totally proficient.
                        We find after 45 minutes students are often ready for a break and ready
                        to go home and practice their new skills. We are happy to work with
                        you for the full hour if you would like. You can schedule another
                        session no sooner than a week later. Practicing for a week on your
                        own will get your skills and body ready for your next session.</p>

                    <dl class="learnToRideQA">
                        <dt><b>Q.</b> I don’t have a bike, can I still take this class?</dt>
                        <dd><b>A.</b> It is best to take this class on your own bike or a bike you
                            are able to borrow for at least few weeks. All bikes feel a little
                            different when you are riding them so it’s helpful to be able to practice
                            at home on the same bike you used in class. That said, we do have adult
                            sized bikes you cab borrow during class but you will not be able to take it
                            home to practice.
                        </dd>
                        <dt><b>Q.</b> Can you guarantee I will be able to ride at the end of this class?</dt>
                        <dd><b>A.</b> No. Everyone learns at different rates and while one new rider
                            may pick it up easily others may have to practice more and work with
                            us a few more times to feel confident.
                        </dd>
                        <dt><b>Q.</b> Can my young child take this class?</dt>
                        <dd><b>A.</b> No. This class is for teens and adults so 13 and older. If you
                            have younger children please see our family class listing.
                        </dd>
                        <dt><b>Q.</b> Why don’t you teach small children to ride?</dt>
                        <dd><b>A.</b> Young children usually don’t need formal instruction to learn
                            to ride. When given a working, properly sized bike and adult encouragement,
                            they usually pick it up quickly. Starting very young children on a
                            strider style bike (pedal-less push bicycle) makes learning to ride a
                            standard bike without training wheels even easier (hint – don’t even
                            put the training wheels on). If you have questions about teaching your
                            child to ride please feel free to give us a call.
                        </dd>
                        <dt><b>Q.</b> I’m not in great shape, can I still learn to ride?</dt>
                        <dd><b>A.</b> This class will not be exceedingly strenuous, but if you
                            have any medical concerns you might want to check with your doctor first.
                        </dd>
                        <dt><b>Q.</b> I have a balance issue, can I still learn to ride?</dt>
                        <dd><b>A.</b> Some people feel like they have “bad balance” and as a
                            result can’t ride a bike. In most cases they just need to spend
                            some time on a working bike and practice a bit to catch on. If
                            you have a diagnosed balance issue or disability, we are happy
                            to work with you using your own adaptive cycle.

                    <p><b>Description:</b> In this class we will start by talking about bike commuting, traffic situations, road placement and answering your questions. The rest of the class will take place on our bikes. We will spend time in a quiet parking lot working on bike handling skills. Once we have those mastered, move onto the street to put our new skills to work. Please note, you must show enough competence on your bike in the parking lot to ride on the street with us. If this is an issue, we will schedule a ride with you on a later date once you have had time to practice your bike skills. Our street ride will include a stop at the WTA station to practice putting your bike on the bus rack, understanding how green bike boxes work, triggering a traffic light and confidently sharing the road with cars.</p>

                        <dt><b>Q.</b> I can ride my bike but I’m not sure I want to ride on the street with cars, can I take this class?</dt>
                        <dd><b>A.</b> Yes. Please come join us for the classroom and parking lot portions of the class. If after that you are still not feeling confident about the street we can make later arrangements for you to do the street ride after you’ve had more time to practice your bike skills.
                        </dd>
                        <dt><b>Q.</b> I’m trying to decide if I want to buy a bike but don’t have one yet. Can I take this class to help me make up my mind?</dt>
                        <dd><b>A.</b> Yes. The best scenario would be for you to find a bike to borrow for a few weeks. That way you will have it around to practice all your new skills to help you decide. If that isn’t possible, we do have bikes you can borrow for the class. In order to borrow a bike you will need to schedule a session (no charge) prior to class to demonstrate adequate bike skills for the class.
