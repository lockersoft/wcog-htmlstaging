                  >We will meet in a quiet parking lot with plenty of room to get started. Depending on your ability
                  level we may remove the pedals from your bike and lower the seat so you can get the feel of balancing
                  by just pushing with your feet. Most people quickly progress to adding the pedals and riding in just
                  one session. You may need more than one session of this class to be totally proficient. We find after
                  45 minutes students are often ready for a break and ready to go home and practice their new skills. We
                  are happy to work with you for the full hour if you would like. You can schedule another session no
                  sooner than a week later. Practicing for a week on your own will get your skills and body ready for
                  your next session.<br /><br /></span

                  It is best to take this class on your own bike or a bike you are able to borrow for at least few
                  weeks. All bikes feel a little different when you are riding them so it’s helpful to be able to
                  practice at home on the same bike you used in class. That said, we do have adult sized bikes you cab
                  borrow during class but you will not be able to take it home to practice.<br /><br /></span

                ><span class="lato-normal-ship-gray-14px">
                  No. Everyone learns at different rates and while one new rider may pick it up easily others may have
                  to practice more and work with us a few more times to feel confident.<br /><br /></span

                ><span class="lato-normal-ship-gray-14px">
                  No. This class is for teens and adults so 13 and older. If you have younger children please see our
                  family class listing.<br /><br /></span

                ><span class="lato-normal-ship-gray-14px">
                  Young children usually don’t need formal instruction to learn to ride. When given a working, properly
                  sized bike and adult encouragement, they usually pick it up quickly. Starting very young children on a
                  strider style bike (pedal-less push bicycle) makes learning to ride a standard bike without training
                  wheels even easier (hint – don’t even put the training wheels on). If you have questions about
                  teaching your child to ride please feel free to give us a call.<br /><br /></span
                ><span class="lato-bold-ship-gray-14px">Q</span

                  This class will not be exceedingly strenuous, but if you have any medical concerns you might want to
                  check with your doctor first.<br /><br /></span

                ><span class="lato-normal-ship-gray-14px">
                  Some people feel like they have “bad balance” and as a result can’t ride a bike. In most cases they
                  just need to spend some time on a working bike and practice a bit to catch on. If you have a diagnosed
                  balance issue or disability, we are happy to work with you using your own adaptive cycle.<br /></span
