                <p>Our community benefits when people make more of their trips by walking, bicycling, sharing rides and
                    riding the bus. Building a partnership with Smart Trips benefits your company. A worksite
                    transportation program can help you:</p>
                <ul class="custom-unordered-list-type-1">
                    <li>Recruit and retain skilled employees who live far from the worksite</li>
                    <li>Create a supportive work environment and build good employee morale</li>
                    <li>Optimize worksite and customer parking</li>
                    <li>Maintain good relations with business and residential neighbors</li>
                    <li>Reach sustainability goals and minimize greenhouse gas emissions</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We can help you establish a worksite program that addresses worksite and environmental challenges by
                    encouraging employees to leave their cars at home and to make Smart Trips. The Whatcom Smart Trips
                    program offers &quot;free services&quot; (link to Employer Services below) to Smart Trips Employer
                    Partners.</p>

                <p>In exchange for these services, we only ask that you designate a Smart Trips coordinator and that you
                    allow that person 1-2 hours per month to administer your program. (Programs for large worksites will
                    take more administration time.)</p>

                <p>In addition to the business benefits of running a Smart Trips employer program, you’ll also make
                    important contributions to our community, such as:</p>

                <ul class="custom-unordered-list-type-1">
                    <li>Reducing traffic congestion</li>
                    <li>Supporting a transportation system that's more efficient and less costly to maintain</li>
                    <li>Providing health benefits to individuals</li>
                    <li>Strengthening social connections</li>
                    <li>Creating a more vibrant business community</li>
                    <li>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other types of air and water pollution</li>
                </ul>
